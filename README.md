#Giving Circles

I'm making this app for family and friends. The idea is, we'll all create registries of gifts we'd like to receive, and then other people in the group can "claim" one or the other.

##ToDos

 * ability to add / remove items from list
 * ability to invite others to group based on email
 * ability to accept an invitation
 * entire concept of "invitations"
 * ability to see others lists in your group
 * ability to "claim" others' items (to buy for them)
 * ability to see whether an item on someone else's list has been claimed
 * email out notifications and such
